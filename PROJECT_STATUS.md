# Project Status

This repository currently contains a lightweight skeleton for "Red Bull Game: Extreme Racing". It includes basic race and multiplayer managers and minimal Unity/Netcode stubs to allow compilation outside the Unity editor. Full gameplay, assets, and scenes are placeholders and require further development in Unity.
